## What are the properties of a Graph?

If you are just starting out with Graphs, you may want to read the first articleÂ [What is a Graph Data Structure?](https://blweb-ac046.web.app/what-is-graph-data-structure). This article focuses on the properties of a graph. They include whether a graph is directed or undirected, does it have multiple edges, and whether or not it has loops. Let's understand what these properties are with examples.

###   
1\. Directed or Undirected Graph

A graph is undirected when it connects either one or two vertices. All of the graphs below are undirected graphs. The edge connecting the vertices do not indicate any order, start or end.
